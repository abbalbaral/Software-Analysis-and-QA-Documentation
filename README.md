# Software Analysis and Quality Assurance (QA) Documentation Portfolio

👋 Welcome! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my core skills in **System Analysis, Design, and Quality Assurance (QA) documentation**, which are foundational requirements for a successful QA Analyst.

This collection demonstrates my ability to:
* Understand the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
* Design professional **Test Strategies** and clear, executable **Test Cases**.
* Translate system requirements into logical designs and testing flows.

---

## Artifacts Included:

### 1. **QA Test Case Documentation**
* [Kavre Guide Booking Test Case](Kavre_Guide_Booking_Test_Case.md)
* **Skill Demonstrated:** Writing structured, **Black-Box Functional Test Cases** (the core requirement for a Manual Tester).

### 2. **Visual Analysis & Design Artifacts**
These diagrams prove a strong logical foundation for system analysis and design.

| Diagram | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** | Shows the flow of data and system processes. |
| **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** | Defines the database structure and relationships. |
| **Use Case Diagram** | Defines user interactions and system functions. |
| **Flow Charts / Sequence Diagrams** | Details the sequential logic of key modules (e.g., Login). |

#### Example Diagrams:
* **System Boundary & Context:**
